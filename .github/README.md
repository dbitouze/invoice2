# invoice2 â€“ Intelligent invoices with LaTeX3

## What is it?

While there already are several solutions for LaTeX invoices, most are either
sum-it-yourself templates and the [invoice](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/invoice)
package, which appears to be unmaintained and fails to work for my documents,
especially documents using KOMA-Script. Since LaTeX3 offers a comfortable
interface for working with caculations, this package (re-)implements invoice
functionalioty using LaTeX3.

## Building the package

invoice2 uses the [l3build](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/l3build) tool to create
the package and documentation files. If your LaTeX distribution is sufficiently
up to date, execute

> ./build.lua ctan

in a source checkout to build a CTAN upload zip and a TDS zip. If you just want
to install a copy of invoice2, execute

> ./build.lua install

to copy the package to your texmf tree.

After building, consult the invoice2.pdf for the actual package documentation.
